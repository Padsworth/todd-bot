**Warning:** this is my first rust project... actually its just my first ever project.
I *do not* think this project is all that special, or all that unique, or even all that good.
But you gotta start somewhere.

It was built for me and my discord server. If you somehow find use from it, I would be impressed.

- Create reminders and events
- Track your birthdays
- Mock your friends with cringy 2020 humor
